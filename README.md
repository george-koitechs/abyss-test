### When creating new item:
* submit by clicking Enter
* cancel by clicking Esc

I haven't added badge near the title (**Services**) because user can't add service (according to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7UZedntwq8)).
That's why I've added _disable_ state to that button.

Also I haven't added **List** button in the header according to video.
